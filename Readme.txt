My repo to hold the code that I write as I work through lib-gdx tutorials
Current branch: Hello World (font version)
This branch contains the classic 'Hello World' program, written using bitmap fonts. This is the second 'Hello World' branch that I have written and differentiates itself from the other branch by using bitmap fonts as opposed to textures/ sprites as I did in the other branch.
Specifically I used multi-line text and wrote out the first entry in the diary of prophecy and justified that text to the centre such that the text would be grouped centred.
