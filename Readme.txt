My repo to hold the code that I write as I work through lib-gdx tutorials
Current Branch: Audio Basics

*in-progress*
This branch contains the code for a basic audio/sound-effects tutorial in lib-gdx
Specifically the branch contains a mp3 file having its volume lowered over time before being stopped entirely anf the timer
being cancelled.
